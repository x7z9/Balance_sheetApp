# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Build a app that use for the balance sheet for the small business owners to know the profit and losses with interactive graphs, include calender also so owner can track the profit and see in graph, provide a section to add the profit and liabilities so that they can know the owner spending in business, simple and minimalistic. Main thing is to save everyday transaction for lifetime and owner can see any spending and profit at any time."

Uses proper MongoDB serialization with UUIDs, date handling, and Pydantic models."

        - agent: "testing"
        - comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: All CRUD endpoints working perfectly. POST /api/transactions creates transactions with proper validation and UUID generation. GET /api/transactions retrieves transactions with correct structure and supports type filtering (income/expense). DELETE /api/transactions/{id} successfully removes transactions and confirms deletion. GET /api/transactions/summary calculates totals correctly (tested: $4300 income, $665.49 expenses, $3634.51 net profit). GET /api/transactions/chart-data returns properly formatted data for visualization. All endpoints handle realistic business transaction data correctly. Minor: Delete endpoint returns 400 instead of 404 for non-existent transactions, but error handling works correctly."

MongoDB integration works flawlessly with proper serialization/deserialization of dates and UUIDs. TransactionCreate model validates input correctly. TransactionSummary model provides accurate financial calculations. All data persists correctly and can be retrieved with proper structure."
